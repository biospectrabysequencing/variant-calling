The vision of this project is to contribute a system that will accelerate the in-silico component of genomic breeding processes i.e. computing variant information from sequencing data. This acceleration will be provided by sole automation of the necessary computing pipelines as well as an enhanced accuracy of variant "calls". A complete automated pipeline cannot be developed in a 2-year timefame as a discovery science project provides as the current VC pipelines do not provide the necessary precision. The sole multitude of pipelines for VC as well as variability of their outputs will make it necessary to create a framework for
comparative analysis of these pipes before any comprehensive solution can be considered. However, such a comparative tool can
be developed within the 2-year framework.

The targeted end-users of any outcome of this work is the breeding community as well as any other research that requires variant information. Quickly acquired, accurate variant information is of substantial importance for any research that requires variant information. A false positive for instance can mislead and therefore substantially delay and prevent results.

Future work will have to comprise the optimisation of VC pipelines. 

During the programme we will:

- Produce an open source trusted reproducible research framework for calling variants from GBS and resequencing data sets.
- Automation of variant calling pipelines with trusted results
- Plug and play usability for end users
- A usable framework with a clear path for continuous improvement.
- Establishing the scientific value of developing an interpretive context.
