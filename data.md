### Point 5 -- Data

The data for this project will consist of both simulated reads/sequences and actual biological reads and sequences.

#### Simulated Data

The use of simulated data is critical for assessing how each tool performs given very specific biases and error types. Using simulation, we can control with great precision both the type of bias to introduce as well as the amount of error in the data. Hence, generation of multiple levels of the independent variables as well as positive and negative controls is greatly facilitated. 

#### Existing Data

For the project we will use existing data that has been collected, or is planned to be, by the named researchers in the use cases. This data will derive from a variety of sources so that real examples of biological challenges can be assessed in the performance of the tools.

* What PFR data could be used?
* Soybean data sets. Both WGS and GBS generated from the sames extraced DNAs (diploid, inbred) This is from the group at Lavall in Canada
* Willow data. These are polyploids of varying levels. (I just requested the data from Larry Smart at Cornell)
* We should look through the literature and contact groups that have published data sets that are interesting from the testing point of view.

#### New Data generated

* What would be good for PFR??
