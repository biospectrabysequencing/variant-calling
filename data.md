### Point 5 -- Data

For the project we will use existing data that has been collected, or is planned to be, by the named researchers in the use cases.

#### Simulated Data

* Maybe Marcus and / or Charles can describe simulated data sets from various species of interest here.

#### Existing Data

* What PFR data could be used?
* Soybean data sets. Both WGS and GBS generated from the sames extraced DNAs (diploid, inbred) This is from the group @ Lavall in Canada
* Willow data. These are polyploids of varying levels. (I just requested the data from Larry Smart @ Cornell)
* We should look through the literature and contact groups that have published data sets that are interesting from the testing point of view.

#### New Data generated

* What would be good for PFR??
