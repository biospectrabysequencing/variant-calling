### Point 2  -- Current Situation

Currently, there is no context for evaluating variant calls generated by the multiple available tools and thus a de-facto method of consensus finding is often employed to hide the interpretation problem. We are running multiple pipelines to discover variants without being able to appraise the accuracy of the variant calls of each of the tools. Very often set operations on the outputs yield unexpected results. Scientists, rightly, have concern over the validity of such outputs and rely heavily on consensus from the multiple tools. There is a critical need to develop an interpretive context for evaluating variant calls given the high value that is placed on such data in downstream analysis.
