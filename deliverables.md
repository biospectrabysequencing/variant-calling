## Key deliverables
**(Maximum 1.5 pages)**
1. _How will this project position PFR for future funding opportunities?_
2. _What will success of this 1-2 year project look like in science terms  e.g. Capability / platform development, know-how, IP, papers, and/or technology produced by the end of the funding term, collaborations developed or strengthened. Bullet point format preferred._
3. _Note the timeline and key milestones (e.g. decision points, outputs or key steps) for achieving the stated outcome and deliverables for this 1-2 year project._

Capability in rigorously calling variants in species of interest.

Knowledge of biological and technical effects on each of the pipelines' ability
to correctly call variants (ROC).
