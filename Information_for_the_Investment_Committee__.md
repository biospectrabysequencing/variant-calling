The work proposed here aligns with the building skills and infrastructure themes of the PFR Statement of Corporate Intent \cite{PlantFoodCorporateIntent2016}, with the express aim to increase productivity and scientific excellence. The increase in productivity will come from our ability to more quickly appraise, utilise, analyse and practically apply the data we collect. The breeding pipelines will be enhanced in the Better Cultivars Faster and Sustainable Premium Seafood through this increase in productivity.

- Increased productivity
- An increased productivity in variant calling will accelaretate genomic breeding
- New cultivars faster will help producing more premium food cultivars
