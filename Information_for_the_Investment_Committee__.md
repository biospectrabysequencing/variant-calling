**(Maximum 1 page)**
1. _How is this work aligned with the PFR Statement of Core Purpose and strategic outcomes?_
2. _Note which strategic outcome(s) this work is expected to contribute to, and state how it is expected to contribute to them:_
    * _Better Cultivars Faster_
    * _Residue-Free Pest and Disease Control_
    * _More Sustainable and Profitable Production Systems_
    * _Proprietary Foods with Price Premiums_
    * _Sustainable Premium Seafood and Marine Products_
3. _If relevant, note any other significant internal or external strategies that this work is expected to contribute to, and state how it will contribute to them, e.g. Te Raranga Ahumara, Internationlisation, National Science Challenges_


The work proposed here aligns with the building skills and infrastructure themes of the PFR Statement of Corporate Intent \cite{PlantFoodCorporateIntent2016}, with the express aim to increase productivity and scientific excellence. The increase in productivity will come from our ability to more quickly appraise, utilise, analyse and practically apply the data we collect. The ncreased productivity will translate into accelerated and accurate variant calling which will enhance breeding pipelines and strongly align with the Better Cultivars Faster and Sustainable Premium Seafood outcomes.
Furthermore, by developing better open source pipelines, this will contribute to PFR's internationalisation by strengthening PFR excellent capabilities in genome-informed breeding for tree crops and finfish breeding.
