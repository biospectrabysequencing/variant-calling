### Point 7 -- Risk Management

The following risks have been identified

**input data**

1. failure to find enough experimental datasets with adequate metadata to fulfil the needs of the workflow.
   The SRA provides an excellent resource of experimental data which requires metadata submission as part of the data submission process.
2. the datasets are too large to ingest or store within practicable limits of systems we have access to.
   Working with Catalyst Ceph storage architecture will reduce this risk significantly.
