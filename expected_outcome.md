###Point 1  -- Expected Outcome

An automated framework for assessing, appraising, comparing and contrasting existing pipelines and the analysis outputs they provide for input data as generated by researchers as well as the exemplar datasets \cite{Torkamaneh_16}.

_The above describes the 'thing' that we'll be making. The expected outcomes should be more than that. e.g. improved accuracy of genetic analyses based on better marker data -- extrapolate from here. --Rob_

We have three use cases to ensure we have the volume and variety of data to trail and stress the framework and ensure practical utility.
