###Point 1  -- Expected Outcome


With this project we aim at accelerating breeding processes by enhancing in-silico productivity as well as interchangeability. The future end result will be an automated variant calling pipeline that allows to plugin research data and visualises the associated phenotype distributions. To progress the research community towards this vision a tool is needed that validates and scrutinises current variant calling pipelines in an automated as well as easy to use manner. This will encompass employing the latest technology in variant calling as well as automation and cloud computing techniques. We intend to deliver acceleration by producing an automated framework for evaluating existing variant call pipelines and the analytic outputs they provide given input data as generated by researchers, as well as exemplar datasets \cite{Torkamaneh_16}. We intend to construct an interpretive context so that genetic inferences can be made with statistical power. Moreover, we intend to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the most commonly used tools so that researchers can make informed choices when analysing their data. By providing scientists and breeders with accurate and contextualized informatics, they will be able to identify better genetic markers with high confidence thereby facilitating the faster and more efficient production of high value crops.

_The above describes the 'thing' that we'll be making. The expected outcomes should be more than that. e.g. improved accuracy of genetic analyses based on better marker data -- extrapolate from here. --Rob_

We have three use cases to ensure we have the volume and variety of data to trail and stress the framework and ensure practical utility.
