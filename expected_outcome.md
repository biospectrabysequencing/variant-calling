###Point 1  -- Expected Outcome

This project will produce an automated framework for evaluating existing variant call pipelines and the analytic outputs they provide given input data as generated by researchers, as well as exemplar datasets \cite{Torkamaneh_16}. We intend to construct an interpretive context so that genetic inferences can be made with statistical power. Moreover, we intend to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the most commonly used tools so that researchers can make informed choices when analysing their data. By providing scientists and breeders with accurate and contextualized informatics, they will be able to identify better genetic markers with high confidence thereby facilitating the faster and more efficient production of high value crops.

_The above describes the 'thing' that we'll be making. The expected outcomes should be more than that. e.g. improved accuracy of genetic analyses based on better marker data -- extrapolate from here. --Rob_

We have three use cases to ensure we have the volume and variety of data to trail and stress the framework and ensure practical utility.
