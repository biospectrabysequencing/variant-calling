## Objective and methods

An automated framework for assessing, appraising, comparing and contrasting existing pipelines and the analysis outputs they provide for input data as generated by researchers as well as the exemplar datasets.

We are running multiple pipelines to discover variants without being able to appraise the accuracy of the variant calls of each of the tools. Very often set operations on the outputs yield unexpected results. Scientists, rightly, have concern over the validity of such outputs and rely heavily on consensus from the multiple tools.


### Outline of methods (1 page)

Development external, using external system to facilitate transparency and accessibility of work with collaborators.

Development of Cloud capability.

#### Use cases

We have three use cases to ensure we have the volume and variety of data to trail and stress the framework and ensure practical utility.

**Samantha Baldwin or Maren Wellenreuther ??**

**Rob Elshire or International ??**

### Data

For the project we will use existing data that has been collected, or is planned to be, by the named researchers in the use cases.
