### Point 3 -- Novelty / Stretch

We intend to test the variant calling pipelines with both real data and simulated data. Moreover, the simulated data will be permuting so as to examine the affects of different forms of bias and errors on the alignment and variant calling processes. To date, this kind of analysis has not been done and is the critical element for establishing an interpretive context. The work done within this proposal will not only provide a foundation in terms of developing a software framework, it will also develop the analytical skill sets necessary to generalise the methodology to other variant calling pipelines and workflows.
