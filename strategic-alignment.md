## Strategic Alignment

The statement of corporate intend mentions in the purpose for PFR that "Plant & Food Research’s purpose is to enhance the value and productivity of New Zealand’s horticultural, arable, seafood and food and beverage industries" \cite{PlantFoodCorporateIntent2016}. This work will contribute to enhancing productivity in the breeding sector and, thus, strategically contributes to one of the main purposes of PFR. Another aspect of our corporate intend is that "our partnerships with these sectors and with research collaborators across the science and innovation system are enabling us to deliver high impact science and innovation system are enabling us to deliver high impact science excellence that has increasing and measurable economics and social value for New Zealand" \cite{PlantFoodCorporateIntent2016}. This project aims at facilitating collaboration in various levels. The outcome of this project is a collaborative platform with initially involved researchers from PFR, Canterbury University, Yale University, and the University of Laval in Quebec. This collaboration will provide research excellency. 

The work is continuing efforts that already exist  and thus have impact in the
following portfolios:
