### Point 6 -- IP / FTO

There are no known IP restrictions. The bulk of the tools that we will be using / testing are released under Free / Open Source software licenses. The best practice in software development dictates that software integrating those components be licensed under a compatible license. This also follows the NZGOAL-SE framework and is regarded as best practice by the NZ central government \cite{NZGOAL-SE_2017}.

We will have to figure out what we can do with the kiwifruit 40 re-sequenced accessions from Paul. 

Apple re-sequencing is OK to be shared and published. Same for manuka, we have Maori engagement sorted.

~~MOU with Elshire Group.~~ -- I'm in favour of putting all this under the NZOSS. Neutral ground and same rules for everyone... (Rob)
